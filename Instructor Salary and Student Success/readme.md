# Instructor Salary and Student Success

This study looks at the links between financial layouts for staff at colleges and the completion rates.


## Summary

The study used data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to look at salaries for instructional, non-instructional, and educational services staff at colleges across America. I utilize multiple linear regression to see if pay for these groups have an impact on the total number of institutional completions.
