## Summary

The study looks at the connections between childhood poverty and education. This is not new research but confirming existing knowledge. This project looks at data from the Common Core of Data, the US Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, and the US Department of Education’s EDFacts initiative. The results of a least squares model were not compelling enough that any set of variables could reliably predict graduation rates for economically-disadvantaged students, and more testing is required to predict this based on district-level data.


### Data Sources

* Common Core of Data (CCD) – the US Department of Education database for primary and secondary education.

* Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) – a program under the US Census Bureau that provides poverty and income estimates for states and counties, in addition to estimates of the number of school-aged children in poverty.

* EDFacts – an initiative under the US Department of Education that analyzes assessment data and completion rates for student cohorts.
