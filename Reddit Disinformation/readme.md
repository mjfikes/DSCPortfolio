# Disinformation on Social Media

This is a research project looking at how disinformation is spread on the social site Reddit

## Summary

This study looks at the social media site Reddit and how users may be spreading disinformation
regarding vaccines. This has been a growing issue and Reddit recently walked back on previous
statements to enforce limitations on groups sharing COVID disinformation. Four groups identified as
being associated with COVID disinformation were analyzed. Data for community operators and
contributors were mapped to find any connections.
There were four communities identified where users who post to all four targeted communities were
also active â€“ Coronavirus, ChurchofCOVID, conspiracy, and worldnews. These subreddits, and conspiracy
in particular, were nearly impossible to untangle from the center of the network graph. This shows they are embedded together, sharing users. The exploration uncovered a few other possible disinformation subreddits to explore, as well as users who post much more frequently than the average.
Finding who these users are and what kind of reach they have is not the difficult part, getting Reddit toact on it is probably the tougher challenge.
