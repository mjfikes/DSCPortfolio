# Gateway Courses and Academic Success

This is a research project exploring the connection between gateway college courses and academic success.


## Summary

This study explores connections between student performance in gateway courses to later
academic success in the setting of a community college. Gateway courses are defined as highenrollment
(>100/year) and high failure rate (>30%) and are traditionally the first college level
for-credit course a student takes in their program. The goal is to see if the number of courses
that result in D and F letter grades in addition to Incomplete and Withdrawal can be used to
predict semester-to-semester retention in new community college students.
The strongest predictor in an ordinary linear squares model is shown to be not the rate of
D/F/I/W grades in gateway courses, but rates of those grades overall. An OLS model showed
some success but predictions were too low to be useful. The decision tree gave better results,
predicting correctly nearly 80% of the time. While the predictive power of DFIW grades is
strong, it is not limited to gateway course success as strongly as it is linked to overall success.
