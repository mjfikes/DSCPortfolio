# Dual Enrollment Pathways

This is a research project attempting to predict the likelihood of dual enrollment students continuing their education.


## Summary

This research investigates data at a community college to find whether or not there is enough data to predict if a high school student taking for-credit courses while still enrolled will continue their education with the college awarding them credits. 

The project involves a classification step handled in Python and a clustering analysis performed in R. 


### Files

* AnalysisFinal.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook containing the code running the classification modeling. Decision trees and random forest classifiers are used to predict whether a student will return or not.

* Cluster_Analysis.Rmd - R Markdown file with code for cluster algorithms, DBScan and PAM.

* data_model.csv - data converted to one-hot encoding for machine models

* Dual_Data_final.xls - output file from student data system, with personally-identifiable information removed

* Dual Enrollment Pathways.docx - written presentation of material

* Pathways to Education.mp4 - video presentation of report material
